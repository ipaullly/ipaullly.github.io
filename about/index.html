title: About
---
I am shy, sensitive, inquisitive, curious, lazy, and anxious. I don't mind jokes
unless they are intent to be hurtful. I don't really have many friends as I consider 
most of the people in my interactions stuck in a paradigm they themselves have no idea exists.
my sworn enemy is anyone i consider selfish and impolite. I am open-minded and 
always on the lookout for interesting conversations
